# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
🔍 **Project Description: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression**

📌 **Objective:**
- Implement a robust credit card fraud detection system using classification techniques, with a focus on Logistic Regression.

🛠️ **Methodology:**
- **Data Collection:**
  - Gathered a dataset containing credit card transactions with labeled fraud and non-fraud instances.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling if necessary.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Extracted relevant features and transformed them to enhance the model's performance.

- **Model Selection:**
  - Chose Logistic Regression as the primary classification algorithm due to its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks.

- **Training and Testing:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained the Logistic Regression model on the training set.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Generated a classification report to assess the model's performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
  - Constructed a confusion matrix to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Explored tuning options for the Logistic Regression model to optimize its performance.

- **Results Interpretation:**
  - Interpreted the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of different features on fraud prediction.

- **Model Deployment:**
  - Deployed the trained model for real-time or batch predictions in a production environment.

📊 **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Classification Report:**
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy metrics for both fraud and non-fraud classes.
